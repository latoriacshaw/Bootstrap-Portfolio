# Bootstrap Demo

In this activity, we'll get some experience working with Bootstrap components. At the same time, we're also going to practice collaborating with another developer using Git and GitHub.

## Instructions

1. Make ONE repository and clone it to User 1's computer.
2. Create an HTML file and link to the Bootstrap CDN.
3. Add a few Bootstrap components to your HTML file.
4. Commit and push the code changes to GitHub.
5. User 2 will now clone/download the repository.
6. Add a few more Bootstrap components.
7. Try to commit and push these new changes from User 2's computer.

## BONUS

Once User 2 has successfully pushed their changes, User 1 should try to `git pull` to see the changes on their computer.
