# The Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension

#### November 2018 Cohort 

-----------------------------------------

## Minimum Requirements

#### Homework

You must complete **90%** of the homework assignments. You can miss no more than **2 assignments**.

Homework submissions **must be on time AS IS**. Late submissions will not be counted. It's okay to submit incomplete work. Don't cheat just to "get it done." Submit what you have.

Two links are required to get credit for each assignment. One link to your **GitHub repository** and one link to the **deployed website**. Even if the deployed site isn't working, submit the link anyway so we know you tried. You won't get credit if you don't attempt deployment.

#### Attendance

Attendance must be maintained at a **95%** rate. You can miss no more than a total of **4 classes**.

Being more than **five minutes** late to class will count as a strike, where three strikes equals one absence.

Skipping the morning session or leaving before the afternoon session will count as an absence for that day.

Permission must be obtained to miss class or it's considered one of your 4 absences. Submitting an "excused absence" in Boot Camp Spot doesn't automatically mean you are excused. A summary of the missed content must also be sent to your SSM and instructor.

#### Projects

You must give a full effort on every group project. There are three projects in total throughout the class, where you will work on a team of 3-5.
